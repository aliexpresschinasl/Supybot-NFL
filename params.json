Do not move nor modify these files unless you know what\r\nyou're doing. Many parts of this plugin will break if these are missing, corrupt or unavailable. I will always\r\nhave the raw and db forms available.\r\n\r\nSecond, since this is more of a personal plugin that I know others use, don't consider this as a general use,\r\neven with the open sourcing. I'm always open for ideas/suggestions, however. Find me on IRC if you have any.\r\n\r\nFeb 11, 2013 - entire rewrite. lots of changes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
