Supybot-NFL
===========

Supybot plugin for NFL things.

NOTE: While I'm open sourcing this plugin, it is mainly intended for my own purposes. After loading
the plugin and satisifying needs, you will need to create the base database: sqlite3 nfl.db < nfl_schema.sql
And the players part I have not released. 

Obviously, you will need to be running Supybot/Limnoria for this to work, along with the various dependencies
for the plugin. I can't help you with this part as its beyond the scope of a plug-in. 

If you need assistance/help, I can't guarantee anything, but you may find me on irc. For those who understand
python and would like to contribute something, please fork and submit a pull request. I'm more than happy to add
in code. Feature suggestions are also welcomed. Much of the expansion of this plugin is due to creative ideas
and also folks putting in some work here.
