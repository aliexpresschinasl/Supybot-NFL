Supybot-NFL
===========

Supybot plugin for NFL/Football things.

NOTE: While I'm open sourcing this plugin, it is mainly intended for my own purposes.

First, I've moved the databases into the db directory. Do not move nor modify these files unless you know what
you're doing. Many parts of this plugin will break if these are missing, corrupt or unavailable. I will always
have the raw and db forms available.

Second, since this is more of a personal plugin that I know others use, don't consider this as a general use,
even with the open sourcing. I'm always open for ideas/suggestions, however. Find me on IRC if you have any.

Feb 11, 2013 - entire rewrite. lots of changes.
